# Physics Simulations Project

This project contains Python scripts for solving two physics problems using numerical simulations and integration techniques. It includes a simulation of the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) and the calculation of Coulomb force between a point charge and a uniformly charged rod. These problems are solved using custom Python code with various numerical methods.

## Features

1. **Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO)**: Simulates the motion of an object in a spring with specified parameters (mass, spring constant, initial position, initial velocity, etc.).
2. **Coulomb Force Calculation**: Calculates the Coulomb force between a point charge and a uniformly charged rod in 1-D space.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

To install the required dependencies, use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to run the code
